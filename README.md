# Twitter-Bot
*Motivation : Wanting to explore different APIs and see what I could build*
###Tech Used:
-Python 3.8
-Python Libraries: Tweepy 4.10, Requests 2.28
-Opensource API's: Openweather API, Twitter API (Elevated access)

###Setup
1. Install the required Packages
>pip install tweepy
>pip install requests
2. Clone the repo into your local system
3. The Twitter API keys are linked to your Twitter Developer account so these are secret and cannot be made public. To make a clone of this bot create your own Dev account and store the following set of keys in your local >config.py
-consumer key (API key)
-consumer secret key (API secret key)
-access token
-access secret token
4. To use Openweather API, create an account and use the given API key. Store the key in >config.py like above.
